Welcome to yash!

You are seeing this message because a user-specific initialization script is
not found at ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/yash/rc or ~/.yashrc.
The current session has been loaded with common
settings that should be useful for many users. To suppress this message, copy
a sample initialization script from ${yashdatadir}/initialization/sample
to ~/.yashrc and make any customization in it if you want. For bare default
settings, put an empty file at ~/.yashrc. Without ~/.yashrc, you will see this
message again next time you start yash.

For more instructions, see the manual at: https://magicant.github.io/yash/doc/
