 Legend:
   +: new feature
   -: removed feature
   =: specification change
   *: bug fix
   x: new bug

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.55 (2023-08-19)

  +  [line-editing] The Enter/Send key ("\et") now has a default
     binding to the command the Ctrl-M key ("\^M") is bound to in each
     mode.
  =  [line-editing] The redraw-all and clear-and-redraw-all commands
     now can be used with an argument to swap their behavior.
  *  Fixed mistranslation in the Japanese language support.
  .  Updated the sample initialization script (yashrc):
    +  Code example for binding Ctrl-L to clear-and-redraw-all.
  .  Updated completion scripts:
    +  Completion for git-switch and pass

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.54 (2023-02-25)

  +  Changing font style of command line predictions with $PS1P, etc.
  +  The '--le-trim-right' option.
  =  When the POSIXly-correct mode is active, the shell now refuses to
     execute built-ins POSIX XCU 2.9.1 lists as utilities that cause
     unspecified results. To implement the new behavior, the previous
     "semi-special" built-ins are now categorized in either of the new
     categories "mandatory" and "elective". The "command" and "type"
     built-ins now report the new categories of such built-ins.
  =  The shell now requires a corresponding external executable to
     exist in $PATH when running a built-in that works like a standard
     external utility even when the POSIXly-correct mode is inactive.
     Such built-ins are now categorized as "substitutive" built-ins.
  =  The "array" built-in is now completely ignored in the POSIXly-
     correct mode. The built-in, formerly a regular built-in, is now
     categorized as an "extension" built-in.
  =  The xtrace option is now ignored while expanding the $PS4
     variable to prevent possible infinite recursion.
  *  The allexport option was wrongly ignored in many assignment
     contexts.
  *  The errexit and errreturn options now work for assignment error
     in a for loop.
  *  The ">" redirection with the noclobber option no longer hangs
     when the operand names a symbolic link to a non-existing file.
  *  The exported value of the $DIRSTACK variable was not being
     updated correctly in the "pushd" and "popd" built-ins.
  *  The effect of "!" no longer applies to the exit status of the
     "break", "continue", and "return" built-ins.
  *  An alias value ending with a blank followed by a line
     continuation no longer subjects the next token to alias
     substitution.
  .  Updated the sample initialization script (yashrc):
    +  The "o" alias for WSL

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.53 (2022-08-23)

  =  The shell now deterministically rejects arithmetic expansions
     that result in undefined behavior.
  *  A non-interactive yash now exits on an assignment error in a for
     loop.
  *  Fixed a bug where command substitutions contained in the regular
     expression inside the "[[ word =~ regex ]]" syntax were not
     parsed correctly.
  *  Fixed a bug where unclosed quotes in an end-of-here-document
     indicator were causing the shell to crash or misbehave.
  *  Fixed a bug where yash crashes when invoked with no argv.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.52 (2021-10-11)

  =  Unquoted multiple empty fields resulting from a single word
     expansion are now removed. For example, the brace expansion {,}
     now expands to no fields rather than two empty fields.
  *  In word expansion, if a field consists of a single non-whitespace
     IFS character, it results in an empty field rather than no field.
  *  "typeset -fp" now correctly distinguishes "<<-FOO" and "<< -FOO".
  *  Fixed possible memory leak caused by improper use of the realloc
     function.
  .  Updated completion scripts:
    *  git: Fixed completion of arguments in a command line containing
       argument-taking options such as "-C".

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.51 (2020-12-12)

  =  When an expansion error occurs, the shell now immediately stops
     expansion rather than trying to expand the remaining part of the
     word.
  =  When there are no positional parameters, "$@""$@" now expands to
     nothing rather than one empty field, as defined in POSIX.
  =  Quote removal in arithmetic expansion has been modified to match
     the behavior defined in POSIX. It no longer allows things like
     $(("2" + \5)).
  =  The quotation rules for the substitution word in a parameter
     expansion inside double-quotes have been changed to match with
     the behavior of other existing shells. For example, "${x-\a'b'}"
     now expands to \a'b' rather than ab.
  =  When there is no command word in a simple command, redirections
     are now performed in a subshell after assignments are performed.
  =  The standard input of asynchronous commands in a non-job-control
     shell is now always implicitly redirected to /dev/null,
     regardless of whether the standard input has already been
     redirected.
  =  Quoted characters are now handled in (almost) the same way as
     Bash in the regular expression in the "[[ word =~ regex ]]"
     syntax.
  *  The "command" built-in with the -v or -V option was printing
     the pathnames of external commands with a redundant leading slash
     when the current working directory is "/" or "//".
  *  Redirections on a subshell command are now evaluated in the
     current shell rather than in the subshell.
  *  When an EXIT trap is executed in a subshell with a redirection,
     the redirection was incorrectly not being applied to the trap.
  *  When job control is off, the "trap" built-in was failing to set
     a new trap for SIGINT and SIGQUIT in an asynchronous command.
  *  When job control is off, SIGINT and SIGQUIT were not being
     ignored if a trap had been set for the signal the main shell
     process.
  *  In pattern matching, when an unescaped backslash results from an
     expansion in the pattern, it is now treated as an escape
     character.
  *  When there are no positional parameters, the nested expansion
     "${{@}}" now expands to nothing rather than one empty field.
  *  Unquoted parentheses and vertical bars now can be used in the
     regular expression in the "[[ word =~ regex ]]" syntax.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.50 (2020-05-31)

  *  With the "-o notify" option enabled, the "fg" built-in was
     redundantly reporting the status of the job that had been resumed
     and exited.
  *  Line-editing no longer hangs when the terminfo database maps a
     key to an empty string.
  *  When $LINENO is exported, external commands now receive the
     correct value of the variable.
  .  Updated the sample initialization script (yashrc):
    +  A wrapper function for the "crontab" command is now installed
       to prevent accidental removal by "crontab -r" where the user
       intends "crontab -e".
  .  Updated completion scripts:
    +  git-rebase: support new options in Git 2.24.0.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.49 (2019-09-22)

  +  '--for-local' option.
  =  The '--no-unset' option now rejects unset variables not only in
     parameter expansion but also in arithmetic expansion.
  *  Expansion of ""$*, ""$@, $*"", and $@"" now correctly yields an
     empty string rather than nothing when there are no positional
     parameters.
  *  The $RANDOM variable was expanding to a value larger than 32767
     on some systems.
  *  The "\e" escape sequence was not working in the "echo" built-in.
  *  When a last command is a subshell, the parent shell's jobs were
     not being cleared when entering the subshell.
  *  The job status was not being updated correctly if a process ID
     was reused by another process before the previous process was
     removed from the job list.
  *  The "typeset" built-in now prints functions that contain a simple
     command whose command name is a keyword in a format that can
     successfully re-parsed by the shell.
  .  Updated completion scripts:
    *  Remote branch names are now correctly completed for the
       argument to Git remote/fetch/pull/push commands.
    *  Local pathname operands are now correctly completed for the
       rsync command.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.48 (2018-12-22)

  +  The double-bracket command (the [[ ... ]] syntax)
  +  The "local" built-in
  +  The '--le-predict-empty' option
  +  The prompt string now can be defined with the $YASH_PS...
     variables.
  =  Command line prediction no longer shows suggestion before you
     start typing a command. Use the new '--le-predict-empty' option
     to restore the previous behavior.
  =  The default value of $PS1 has been changed.
  *  The line number is now correctly counted in arithmetic
     expansions that contain newlines.
  *  Subshells in the EXIT trap were unexpectedly exiting with the
     exit status of the last command executed before the EXIT trap on
     the main shell.
  *  A new EXIT trap that was set in a subshell in the EXIT trap was
     unexpectedly being ignored.
  *  The "typeset" built-in was crashing when printing a function that
     contains a here-document that contains a command substitution
     that contains more than one command.
  *  The "typeset" built-in was forgetting to print here-document
     contents when printing a function that contains a process
     substitution (or redirection) that contains here-documents.
  *  The variable name token in the for command and the word following
     a here-document redirection operator are now correctly parsed
     even when it resulted from an alias substitution whose value
     begins with a blank.
  *  The "do" keyword in a for loop is no longer subject to alias
     substitution.
  *  An invalid semicolon that appears at the beginning of a line as a
     result of alias substitution in a for loop is now correctly
     rejected.
  .  For more strict POSIXly-correctness, some syntactic constructions
     are now regarded as an error in the POSIXly-correct mode:
    *  An IO_NUMBER token cannot be the operand of a redirection.
    *  Keywords immediately following a redirection are not
       recognized.
  .  Updated the sample initialization script (yashrc):
    =  The prompt strings are now defined with the $YASH_PS...
       variables.
    *  Window title update should now work on more terminals.
    *  Any predefined handlers for SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, and SIGTTOU are
       now cancelled so that jobs can be suspended properly.
  .  Updated completion scripts:
    *  git: pathnames are now correctly completed with the latest Git.
    +  git-grep: support new options in Git 2.19.1.
    +  git-stash: support new options in Git 2.18.0.
    +  ping: support some common options
    =  ssh, ssh-keygen: support new options in OpenSSH 7.7.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.47 (2018-04-11)

  +  '--errreturn' option.
  =  Expansion results printed by the -x option is now quoted to
     disambiguate presence of special characters.
  =  When the shell prints aliases, variables, key bindings, etc. they
     are now printed with less quotes.
  *  The "set" built-in without any argument now prints not only local
     variables but also global.
  *  The "." built-in no longer leaves temporary positional parameters
     after a file-not-found error.
  *  The ">" redirection with the noclobber option is now more
     reliable than before. Previously, there was little possibility of
     overwriting an existing regular file in case another process
     simultaneously replaces the file.
  .  Updated the sample initialization script (yashrc):
    +  Example code for enabling "direnv".

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.46 (2017-10-28)

  =  Global aliases are now substituted in all locations, including
     part of compound commands where only operators are syntactically
     acceptable.
  *  The shell now reads and executes all shell commands line by line.
     Previously, commands that are not from a file or the standard
     input were parsed all at once before being executed.
  *  After alias substitution where the alias value ends with a blank,
     the next word is also subject to alias substitution, but
     previously this substitution was being applied only once, which
     was a different behavior from many other shells.
  *  After alias substitution where the alias value ends with a blank,
     global aliases were being applied twice, which is now just once.
  *  Line continuations no longer prevent recursive alias
     substitution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.45 (2017-07-05)

  +  [line-editing] new line-editing commands:
        complete-max-then-list, complete-max-then-next-candidate,
        complete-max-then-prev-candidate
  =  In prompt strings $PS1 and $PS2, the job count printed by the \j
     notation included finished jobs that have not yet waited for.
     That was confusing, so the job count no longer includes finished
     jobs that have once had its "Done" status reported to the user.
  =  The "jobs" built-in, with the -n option, no longer clears
     finished jobs that are not being reported.
  *  In arithmetic expansion, unset variables now successfully expand
     to a value of "0".
  *  With the "-o notify" option, job status change was not being
     printed until the shell receives a SIGCHLD.
  .  Updated the default initialization script (yashrc):
    +  Confirm before clearing the whole history by "history -c'.
  .  Updated completion scripts:
    +  carthage: --cache-builds option
    *  git: at most 10 candidates are now proposed for a commit hash.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.44 (2017-01-17)

  +  Command line prediction and the '--le-predict' option.
  +  A default initialization script is automatically loaded if the
     ~/.yashrc file cannot be loaded.
  =  During shell startup, $YASH_LOADPATH is now initialized only if
     not set in the environment.
  *  Updated completion script for: carthage, git, git-log,
     git-revert, git-submodule, ssh
  *  The "return" built-in was wrongly refusing to return from a
     script sourced by the "." built-in in an interactive shell.
  *  In the "test" built-in, the unary "-o" operator was returning the
     wrong answer if the given option name was negated with the "no"
     prefix (e.g. "test -o noclobber").
  *  The "wait" built-in now returns an exit status of 1 if any
     operand is invalid, ignoring results for any other operands.
  *  In a for loop without the "in" keyword, a semicolon that delimits
     the variable name, if any, now must appear on the same line as
     the variable name.
  =  Support for POSIX.1-2008 Technical Corrigendum 2 (2016).
     This affects the shell's behavior only in the POSIXly-correct
     mode unless marked with (*) in the following:
    .  In a pipeline, the reserved word "!" must now be delimited by
       a white space when followed by a parenthesis "(".
    .  In a for loop without the "in" keyword, the variable name and
       the "do" keyword can now be separated by a semicolon.
    .  Variables that are assigned in a simple command whose command
       is a function no longer persist after the function finishes.
    .  The standard input of an asynchronous command is now implicitly
       redirected to /dev/null when job control is off. Previously,
       this was done when the shell was interactive in the POSIXly-
       correct mode.
    .  The SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals on an asynchronous command are
       now ignored only when job control is off.
    .  The "bindkey", "complete", "dirs", "disown", "hash", "help",
       "history", "popd", "pushd", "suspend", "type", "typeset", and
       "ulimit" built-ins are now semi-special built-ins.
    .  The "break" and "continue" built-ins now interrupt lexically
       enclosing loops only. (*)
    .  Unquoted $* and $@ now expand to separate positional
       parameters, even if $IFS is an empty string. (*)
    .  On an assignment error, a non-interactive shell now always
       exits, regardless of command type. (*)
    .  When any error occurs in a special built-in in non-interactive
       shell, the shell now exits, regardless of error type.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.43 (2016-09-22)

  *  Updated completion script for: carthage, cd, su

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.42 (2016-08-27)

  +  '--pipefail' option.
  +  New completion script for: carthage, dnf, git-rev-parse, tree,
     watch
  +  Updated completion script for: cd, git, git-bisect, git-rev-list
     (Git 2.9.2).
  =  Yash now supports the 2013 edition of POSIX.1-2008.
  =  Unclosed here-documents are now always rejected.
  =  A job-control shell now ignores SIGTTIN and SIGTTOU by default.
  =  Line-editing can now be interrupted by SIGINT.
  =  The "-o errexit" option is now applied to redirection errors on
     compound commands and expansion errors in the for and case
     commands.
  *  In backquoted command substitutions that occur in double quotes,
     backslashes that escape a double quote are now handled before the
     containing command is parsed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.41 (2016-03-20)

  +  '--emptylastfield' option.
  +  New option for the "shift" built-in: -A
  +  The "shift" built-in now accepts negative counts.
  +  New completion script for: git-notes, git-reflog, git-worktree
  =  The non-interactive shell now exits on an assignment error
     in a simple command without a command name.
  =  The exit status is now non-zero when a for loop has been
     interrupted because of an read-only variable.
  =  When there is no positional parameter, the word """$@" is now
     expanded to an empty word, producing the same result as "$@""".
  =  The behavior of field splitting has been modified to match the
     intended interpretation of POSIX: If field splitting yields more
     than one field and the last field is empty, the last field is now
     removed.
  =  The "read" built-in now removes leading whitespaces when
     assigning the last input value to the variable.
  =  The first character of $IFS is now always used as a separator
     when concatenating positional parameters. Previously, $IFS was
     ignored in some corner cases.
  *  Unclosed process redirections are now detected as syntax error.
  *  When $ECHO_STYLE was GNU or ZSH, the "echo" built-in was
     incorrectly ignoring single hyphen operands.
  *  The "typeset" built-in was crashing when used with a temporary
     assignment to a variable not specified in the built-in operands.
  *  In the "typeset" built-in, the -r option was not effective when
     printing functions.
  *  The "typeset" built-in now detects combination of the -f and -g
     options as an error.
  *  The "fg" and "bg" built-ins no longer try to resume a non-job-
     controlled job when given no operand.
  *  In range brace expansion, integers were not always parsed
     correctly.
  *  The "fc" built-in was not handling the history range correctly
     when the range was specified with an unused entry number.
  *  The "fc" built-in was incorrectly rejecting the syntax of the
     form "fc -s foo=bar n".
  *  The interactive shell was unexpectedly forgetting the exit status
     of background jobs when reporting the job status.
  *  Fixed potential undefined behavior during reading a history file.
  *  Parameter expansions of the form ${foo/bar/baz} are now rejected
     in the POSIXly-correct mode, as documented in the manual.
  *  Single- or double-quoted empty words were incorrectly being
     removed in field splitting.
  *  Backslash escapes are now recognized in parameter indexes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.40 (2016-01-09)

  =  The "unset" built-in no longer rejects variable names containing
     the "=" symbol as an error. They are now silently ignored.
  =  In the POSIXly-correct mode, unclosed here-documents are now
     treated as an error.
  *  Fixed possible arithmetic overflow errors in memory allocation
     which might result in an undefined behavior.
  *  Fixed crash on assigning a floating-point number in arithmetic
     expansion.
  *  Fixed memory leak on finding a command in a relative path from
     $PATH.
  *  The parameter expansion ${foo##bar*} was being treated like
     ${foo##bar} where the asterisk should match up to the end of the
     parameter value.
  *  The parameter expansion ${foo%%*} was being expanded to ${foo}
     where it should expand to an empty string.
  *  The "getopts" built-in no longer rejects digits as option
     characters.
  *  The non-interactive shell no longer exits when the "command"
     built-in executes the "." built-in and the script is not found.
  *  Fixed incorrect exit status of simple commands where command
     substitution is performed during command word expansion which
     yields no command line words.
  *  The "exec" built-in now correctly exits with an exit status of
     127 for a script file not found.
  *  Pipes were not being connected as expected during command word
     expansion.
  *  The "fg" and "bg" built-ins now report an error when they fail to
     print the job name.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.39 (2015-08-27)

  +  New options for the "read" built-in: -e, -P, -p
  +  New completion script for: passwd, valgrind
  -  The configuration option '--disable-alias' has been dropped.
  =  The "read" built-in now requires the -e (--line-editing) option
     to enable line-editing.
  =  The behavior of the "trap" built-in now conforms to POSIX.1-2013.
     The built-in prints the traps for the calling shell rather than
     the subshell when it is executed in a command substitution.
  =  The manual for the "return" built-in has been clarified as to
     what the built-in can return from. The behavior of the built-in
     has been modified accordingly. It no longer interrupts the "eval"
     and "fc" built-ins.
  *  Crash on division by zero with the "/=" or "%=" operator
     in arithmetic expansion.
  *  Crash in the "complete" built-in called without the -D option.
  *  Yash no longer tries to find the profile and rcfile scripts in
     the root directory when $HOME is not set.
  *  The "read" built-in with a single operand was failing to trim
     initial IFS whitespaces in field splitting.
  *  The "read" built-in was not handling backslashes correctly in
     field splitting if $IFS contained a backslash.
  *  The "-o allexport" option was being ignored when an array is
     assigned by the "read" built-in with the -A option.
  *  Traps are no longer handled while waiting for input with line-
     editing in the "read" built-in.
  *  Operands to the "set" built-in are now correctly completed.
  *  Minor fix in completion script for "git-svn".

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.38 (2015-06-21)

  +  New completion scripts for: git-rm
  =  In the POSIXly-correct mode, functions must now be defined with a
     portable name.
  *  Backslashes following IFS characters were wrongly being dropped
     in field splitting.
  *  In the POSIXly-correct mode, non-portable variable names are no
     longer allowed in for loops.
  *  Completion error on words following a tilde expansion.
  *  Completion error on moved or copied tracked files for git-add and
     git-commit.
  *  Completion error on untracked file for git-commit.

  +  New completion scripts for: git-describe, tig.
  +  Updated completion script for: git-branch (Git 1.9.0).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

     ssh, ssh-add, ssh-keygen (OpenSSH 6.2)
  =  The condition for exiting the shell when the -e option is enabled
     has been changed in accordance with the 2013 edition of
     POSIX.1-2008.
  =  The "++" and "--" operators are no longer supported in the
     POSIXly-correct mode.
  =  The $RANDOM variable now always returns random numbers, ignoring
     the value from the environment variable, if any.
  =  If yash encounters a too long line that cannot be handled while
     reading a history file, it now tries to keep reading the rest of
     the file rather than stopping reading.
  =  Very long command lines are no longer saved in the history file.
  *  Minor fix in a syntax error message.
  *  Minor fix in completion script for "git", "ssh" and "rsync".

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.34 (2013-02-23)

  +  New "test" built-in operator: =~, -o (unary)
  +  New completion scripts for:
     configure, git-name-rev, git-request-pull, make, rsync
  =  A syntax error or expansion error in .yash_profile or .yashrc
     no longer makes the shell exit even when the shell is not
     interactive.

     hit the backspace key.
  =  In line-editing, the undo history is no longer saved for each
     backspace.
  *  Fixes in completion scripts for "git".

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yash 2.33 (2012-10-27)

  =  The "help" built-in now prints brief usage of built-ins.
  =  Some error messages for command syntax error have been revised.
  =  Some built-ins now check command syntax more strictly.
  *  The "set" built-in aborts the shell on a command syntax error
     as specified in POSIX.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
