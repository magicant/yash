//:title: Yash manual - Jobs built-in

The dfn:[jobs built-in] reports job status.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +jobs [-lnprs] [{{job}}...]+

[[description]]
== Description

The jobs built-in prints information of link:job.html[jobs] the shell is
currently controlling.

By default, the following information is printed for each job, line by line:

- the job number,
- the +&#43;+ or +-+ symbol if the job is the current or previous job,
  respectively,
- the status, and
- the command string.

[[options]]
== Options

+-l+::
+--verbose+::
Print the process ID, status, and command string for each process in the jobs.

+-n+::
+--new+::
Print new jobs only: jobs whose status has never been reported since the
status changed.

+-p+::
+--pgid-only+::
Print process group IDs of jobs only.

+-r+::
+--running-only+::
Print running jobs only.

+-s+::
+--stopped-only+::
Print stopped jobs only.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{job}}s::
The link:job.html#jobid[job IDs] of jobs to be reported.
When no {{job}} is specified, all jobs under the shell's control are reported.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status of the jobs built-in is zero unless there is any error.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The jobs built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[semi-special built-in].

The POSIX standard defines the +-l+ and +-p+ options only:
other options cannot be used in the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode].
In the POSIXly-correct mode, the effect of the +-l+ option is different in
that status is reported for each job rather than for each process.

The process group ID of a job executed by yash is equal to the process ID of
the first command of the link:syntax.html#pipelines[pipeline] that forms the
job.
