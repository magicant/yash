This section describes how commands are executed.

[[simple]]
== Execution of simple commands

link:syntax.html#simple[A simple command] is executed as follows:

. All tokens in the simple command are link:expand.html[expanded] except for
  assignment and redirection tokens.
  If an error occurs during expansion, the execution of the simple command is
  aborted with a non-zero exit status.
  +
  In the following steps, the first word of the expansion results is referred
  to as dfn:[command name], and the other words as dfn:[command arguments].
  If there is only one word of the expansion results, there are no command
  argument words.
  If there are none of the expansion results, there is no command name either.
. link:redir.html[Redirection] specified in the command, if any, is processed.
  The word token after each redirection operator is expanded.
  If an error occurs during processing redirection (including when expanding
  the word token), the execution of this simple command is aborted with a
  non-zero exit status.
. Assignments specified in the command, if any, are processed.
  For each assignment token, the value is expanded and assigned to the
  specified link:params.html#variables[variable].
  If an error occurs during assignments (including when expanding the values
  to be assigned), the execution of this simple command is aborted with a
  non-zero exit status.
  - If there is no command name or the name denotes a
    link:builtin.html#types[special built-in] or <<function,function>>, the
    assignments are permanent: the assigned values remain after the command
    has finished (until the variable is reassigned).
  - Otherwise, the assignments are temporary: the assigned values only last
    during the execution of this simple command.
    The assigned variables are automatically exported.
. If there is no command name, the command execution ends with the exit status
  of zero (unless there are any link:expand.html#cmdsub[command substitutions]
  in the command, in which case the exit status of the simple command is that
  of the last executed command substitution).
. A command to be executed is determined using the <<search,command search
  algorithm>> and the command is executed.
+
--
If the command was executed, the exit status of this simple command is that
of the executed command.
If the algorithm failed to determine a command, no command is executed and
the exit status is 127.
If the shell failed to execute the determined command, the exit status is
126.
If the executed command was killed by a signal, the exit status is the
unique number that corresponds to the signal and is larger than 128.

- If the command is an external command, the command is executed by creating
  a new <<subshell,subshell>> and calling the ``exec'' system call in the
  subshell.
  The command name and arguments are passed to the executed command.
  Exported variables are passed to the executed command as environment
  variables.
- If the command is a link:builtin.html[built-in], the built-in is executed
  with the command arguments passed to the built-in.
- If the command is a <<function,function>>, the contents of the function
  are executed with the command arguments as function arguments.

If the shell is not in the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode] and the
algorithm failed to determine a command, the command
ifdef::basebackend-html[]
pass:[<code><a href="_eval.html">eval</a> -i -- "${COMMAND_NOT_FOUND_HANDLER-}"</code>]
endif::basebackend-html[]
ifndef::basebackend-html[`eval -i -- "${COMMAND_NOT_FOUND_HANDLER-}"`]
is evaluated.
During the command execution, link:params.html#positional[positional
parameters] are temporarily set to the command name and arguments that
resulted in the first step.
Any <<localvar,local variables>> defined during the execution are removed
when the execution is finished.
The +HANDLED+ local variable is automatically defined with the initial value
being the empty string.
If the +HANDLED+ variable has a non-empty value when the execution of the
command string is finished, the shell pretends that the command was
successfully determined and executed.
The exit status of the simple command is that of the command string in this
case.

[[search]]
=== Command search

A command that is executed in a simple command is determined by the command
name using the following algorithm:

. If the command name contains a slash (+/+), the whole name is treated as the
  pathname of an external command. The external command is determined as the
  executed command.
. If the command name is a link:builtin.html#types[special built-in], the
  built-in is determined as the executed command.
. If the command name is the name of an existing <<function,function>>, the
  function is determined as the executed command.
. If the command name is a link:builtin.html#types[semi-special built-in], the
  built-in is determined as the executed command.
. If the command name is a link:builtin.html#types[regular built-in], the
  built-in is determined as the executed command unless the shell is in the
  link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode].
. The shell searches the PATH for a executed command:
+
--
The value of the link:params.html#sv-path[+PATH+ variable] is separated by
colons.
Each separated part is considered as a directory pathname
(an empty pathname denotes the current working directory).
The shell searches the directories (in the order of appearance) and checks if
any directory directly contains an executable regular file whose name is equal
to the command name.
If such a file is found: 

- If the command name is the name of a built-in, the built-in is determined as
  the executed command.
- Otherwise, the file is determined as the executed command.
  (The file will be executed as an external command.)

If no such file is found, no command is determined as the executed command.
--

When the shell finds a file that matches the command name during the search
above, the shell remembers the pathname of the file if it is an absolute path.
When the algorithm above is used for the same command name again, the shell
skips searching and directly determines the command to be executed.
If an executable regular file no longer exists at the remembered pathname,
however, the shell searches again to update the remembered pathname.
You can manage remembered pathnames using the link:_hash.html[hash built-in].

[[exit]]
== Termination of the shell

The shell exits when it reached the end of input and has parsed and executed
all input commands or when the link:_exit.html[exit built-in] is executed.
The exit status of the shell is that of the last command the shell executed
(or zero if no commands were executed).
The exit status of the shell is always between 0 and 255 (inclusive).
If the exit status of the last command is 256 or larger, the exit status 
the shell will be the remainder of the exit status divided by 256.

If an exit handler has been registered by the link:_trap.html[trap built-in],
The handler is executed just before the shell exits.
The exit status of the commands executed in the handler does not affect the
exit status of the shell.

If a non-link:interact.html[interactive] shell encountered one of the
following errors, the shell immediately exits with a non-zero exit status:

- A command cannot be parsed due to an syntax error.
- A link:builtin.html#types[special built-in] is executed in the
  link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode] and the command arguments do not meet
  the syntax of the built-in's arguments.
- An error occurs during redirection or assignment in a
  link:syntax.html#simple[simple command] whose command name is a special
  built-in and the shell is in the POSIXly-correct mode.
- An error occurs during link:expand.html[expansion].

[NOTE]
Some shells other than yash exit when they fail to find a command to execute
in <<search,command search>>.

[[function]]
== Functions

dfn:[Functions] allow executing a link:syntax.html#compound[compound command]
as a link:syntax.html#simple[simple command].
A function can be defined by the link:syntax.html#funcdef[function definition
command] and executed by a simple command.
You can use the link:_unset.html[unset built-in] to remove function
definitions.

There are no functions predefined when yash is started.

A function is executed by executing its body, which is a compound command.
While the function is being executed, link:params.html#positional[positional
parameters] are set to the arguments given to the function.
The old positional parameters are restored when the function execution
finishes.

[[localvar]]
=== Local variables

dfn:[Local variables] are temporary variables that are defined in a function
and existent during the function execution only.
They can be defined by the link:_typeset.html[typeset built-in].
They are removed when the function execution finishes.

Local variables may _hide_ variables that have already been defined before
the function execution had started.
An existing variable becomes inaccessible if a local variable of the same name
is defined in a function.
The old variable becomes accessible again when the function execution
finishes.

You cannot create a local variable when not executing a function.
A normal variable is created if you try to do so.

[[environment]]
== Command execution environment

The shell holds following properties during execution.

- The working directory
- Open file descriptors
- The file creation mask (link:_umask.html[umask])
- The set of signals whose handler is set to ``ignore'' (link:_trap.html[trap])
- link:params.html#variables[Environment variables]
- Resource limits (link:_ulimit.html[ulimit])

Those properties are inherited from the invoker of the shell to the shell, and
from the shell to each external command executed by the shell.

The properties can be changed during the execution of the shell by built-in
commands, variable assignments, etc.

[[subshell]]
=== Subshells

A dfn:[subshell] is a copy of the shell process.
Subshells are used in execution of link:syntax.html#grouping[groupings],
link:syntax.html#pipelines[pipelines], etc.

Subshells inherit functions, aliases, etc. defined in the shell as well as the
properties above since subshells are copies of the shell process.
Notable exceptions are:

- Signal handlers registered by the link:_trap.html[trap built-in] are all
  reset in subshells except for ones whose action is set to ``ignore''.
- The link:interact.html[interactive] mode and link:job.html[job control] are
  disabled in subshells.
  Jobs are not inherited to subshells.

Subshells are executed independently of the original shell, so changes of
any properties above do not affect those of the original shell.
