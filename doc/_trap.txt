//:title: Yash manual - Trap built-in

The dfn:[trap built-in] sets or prints signal handlers.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +trap+
- +trap {{action}} {{signal}}...+
- +trap {{signal_number}} [{{signal}}...]+
- +trap -p [{{signal}}...]+

[[description]]
== Description

The trap built-in sets or prints actions that are taken when the shell
receives signals.
(Those actions are called dfn:[traps].)

When executed with {{action}} and one or more {{signal}}s, the built-in sets
the traps for {{signal}}s to {{action}}.
If the shell receives one of the signals, the action will be taken.

If the first operand is {{signal_number}} instead of {{action}}, the built-in
resets the traps for {{signal_number}} and {{signal}}s as if {{action}} was
+-+.

When executed with the +-p+ (+--print+) option or with no operands, the
built-in prints currently set traps to the standard output in a format that
can be executed as commands that restore the current traps.
If one or more {{signal}}s are specified, only those signals are printed.
Otherwise, all signals with non-default actions are printed.
(In some situations, however, the built-in may print previous trap settings
instead of the current. See notes below.)

[[options]]
== Options

+-p+::
+--print+::
Print current trap settings.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{action}}::
An action that will be taken when {{signal}} is received.
+
If {{action}} is a single hyphen (+-+), the action is reset to the default
action that is defined by the operating system.
If {{action}} is an empty string, the signal is ignored on receipt.
Otherwise, {{action}} is treated as a command string: the string is parsed and
executed as commands when the signal is received.
(If a signal is received while a command is being executed, the action is
taken just after the command finishes.)

{{signal}}::
The number or name of a signal.
+
If {{signal}} is number +0+ or name +EXIT+, it is treated as a special
imaginary signal that is always received when the shell exits.
The action set for this signal is taken when the shell exits normally.

{{signal_number}}::
This is like {{signal}}, but must be a number.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status of the trap built-in is zero unless there is any error.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The trap built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[special built-in].

The POSIX standard requires that signal names must be specified without the
+SIG+-prefix, like +INT+ and +QUIT+.
As an extension, yash accepts +SIG+-prefixed names like +SIGINT+ and +SIGQUIT+
and treats signal names case-insensitively.

=== Reusing output of the built-in

Output of the trap built-in can be saved in a variable, which can be later
executed by the link:_eval.html[eval built-in] to restore the traps.

----
saved_traps=$(trap)
trap '...' INT
eval "$saved_traps"
----

There are some tricks behind the scenes to allow this idiom. You use a
link:expand.html#cmdsub[command substitution] to save the output of the trap
built-in in the variable. The command substitution is executed in a
link:exec.html#subshell[subshell]. The subshell resets all traps (except
ignored ones) at the beginning of itself. This seemingly would result in
(almost) empty output from the built-in that would fail to restore the traps
as expected.

To avoid that pitfall, POSIX requires the shell to follow one of the two
options below:

- If a command substitution just contains a single trap built-in, traps should
  not be reset when the subshell is started to execute the built-in; or
- A subshell always resets the traps but remembers the previous traps. If the
  trap built-in is executed in the subshell but no other trap built-in has
  been executed to modify traps in the subshell, then the built-in should
  print the remembered traps.

Yash obeys the second.
