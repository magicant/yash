The dfn:[getopts built-in] parses command options.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +getopts {{optionlist}} {{variable}} [{{argument}}...]+

[[description]]
== Description

The getopts built-in parses link:builtin.html#argsyntax[single-character
options] that appear in {{argument}}s.
Each time the built-in is invoked, it parses one option and assigns the option
character to {{variable}}.

The {{optionlist}} operand is a list of option characters that should be
accepted by the parser.
In {{optionlist}}, an option that takes an argument should be specified as the
option character followed by a colon.
For example, if you want the +-a+, +-b+ and +-c+ options to be parsed and the
+-b+ option to take an argument, then {{optionlist}} should be +ab:c+.

When an option that takes an argument is parsed, the argument is assigned to
the link:params.html#sv-optarg[+OPTARG+ variable].

When an option that is not specified in {{optionlist}} is found or when an
option argument is missing, the result depends on the first character of
{{optionlist}}:

- If {{optionlist}} starts with a colon, the option character is assigned to
  the +OPTARG+ variable and {{variable}} is set to either +?+ (when the option
  is not in {{optionlist}}) or +:+ (when the option argument is missing).
- Otherwise, {{variable}} is set to +?+, the +OPTARG+ variable is unset, and
  an error message is printed.

The built-in parses one option for each execution.
For all options in a set of command line arguments to be parsed, the built-in
has to be executed repeatedly with the same arguments.
The built-in uses the link:params.html#sv-optind[+OPTIND+ variable] to
remember which {{argument}} should be parsed next.
When the built-in is invoked for the first time, the variable value must be
+1+, which is the default value.
You must not modify the variable until all the options have been parsed, when
the built-in sets the variable to the index of the first operand in
{{argument}}s.
(If there are no operands, it will be set to the number of {{argument}}s plus
one.)

When you want to start parsing a new set of {{argument}}s, you have to reset
the +OPTIND+ variable to +1+ beforehand.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{optionlist}}::
A list of options that should be accepted as valid options in parsing.

{{variable}}::
The name of a variable the result is to be assigned to.

{{argument}}s::
Command line arguments that are to be parsed.
+
When no {{argument}}s are given, the link:params.html#positional[positional
parameters] are parsed.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

If an option is found, whether or not it is specified in {{optionlist}}, the
exit status is zero.
If there is no more option to be parsed, the exit status is non-zero.

[[example]]
== Example

----
aopt=false bopt= copt=false
while getopts ab:c opt
do
  case $opt in
  a) aopt=true ;;
  b) bopt=$OPTARG ;;
  c) copt=true ;;
  \?) return 2 ;;
  esac
done
if $aopt;          then echo Option -a specified;       fi
if [ -n "$bopt" ]; then echo Option -b $bopt specified; fi
if $copt;          then echo Option -c specified;       fi
shift $((OPTIND - 1))
echo Operands are: $*

[[notes]]
== Notes

In {{argument}}s that are parsed, options must precede operands.
The built-in ends parsing when it encounters the first operand.

The getopts built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[semi-special built-in].

The POSIX standard does not specify what will happen when the +OPTIND+
variable is assigned a value other than +1+.
