//:title: Yash manual - Exit built-in

The dfn:[exit built-in] causes the shell process to exit.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +exit [-f] [{{exit_status}}]+

[[description]]
== Description

The exit built-in causes the current shell (or
link:exec.html#subshell[subshell]) process to exit.

If an interactive shell has a stopped link:job.html[job], the shell prints a
warning message and refuses to exit.
To force the shell to exit regardless, specify the +-f+ (+--force+) option or
execute the built-in twice in a row.

If an EXIT link:_trap.html[trap] has been set, the shell executes the trap
before exiting.

[[options]]
== Options

+-f+::
+--force+::
Suppress warnings that would prevent the shell from exiting.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{exit_status}}::
A non-negative integer that will be the exit status of the exiting shell.
+
If this operand is omitted, the exit status of the shell will be that of the
last command executed before the exit built-in (but, if the built-in is
executed during a link:_trap.html[trap], the exit status of the last command
before the trap is entered).
+
If {{exit_status}} is 256 or larger, the actual exit status will be
the remainder of {{exit_status}} divided by 256.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

Because the built-in causes the shell to exit, there is no exit status of the
built-in.

As an exception, if the shell refused to exit, the exit status of the built-in
is non-zero.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The exit built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[special built-in].

The POSIX standard defines no options for the exit built-in;
the built-in accepts no options in the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode].

The POSIX standard provides that the {{exit_status}} operand should be between
0 and 255 (inclusive).
Yash accepts integers larger than 255 as an extension.

If the built-in is executed during an EXIT link:_trap.html[trap], the shell
just exits without executing the trap again.
If {{exit_status}} was not specified, the exit status of the shell is what the
exit status would be if the trap had not been set.
See also link:exec.html#exit[Termination of the shell].
