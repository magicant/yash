//:title: Yash manual - Fc built-in

The dfn:[fc built-in] re-executes or prints commands from
link:interact.html#history[command history].

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +fc [-qr] [-e {{editor}}] [{{start}} [{{end}}]]+
- +fc -s[q] [{{old}}={{new}}] [{{start}}]+
- +fc -l[nrv] [{{start}} [{{end}}]]+

[[description]]
== Description

When executed without the +-l+ (+--list+) option, the built-in executes the
commands in the link:interact.html#history[command history] range specified by
the operands.
If the +-s+ (+--silent+) option is not specified, the shell invokes an editor
which allows you to edit the commands before they are executed.
The commands are executed when you quit the editor.
If the +-s+ (+--silent+) option is specified, the commands are immediately
executed.
In either case, the executed commands are printed to the standard output and
added to the history.

When executed with the +-l+ (+--list+) option, the built-in prints the
commands in the command history range specified by the operands.
By default, commands are printed with their history entry numbers, but output
format can be changed using the +-n+ (+--no-numbers)+) and +-v+ (+--verbose+)
options.

[[options]]
== Options

+-e {{editor}}+::
+--editor={{editor}}+::
Specify an editor that is used to edit commands.
+
If this option is not specified, the value of the
link:params.html#sv-fcedit[+FCEDIT+ variable] is used.
If the variable is not set either, +ed+ is used.

+-l+::
+--list+::
Print command history entries.

+-n+::
+--no-numbers+::
Don't print entry numbers when printing history entries.

+-q+::
+--quiet+::
Don't print commands before executing.

+-r+::
+--reverse+::
Reverse the order of command entries in the range.

+-s+::
+--silent+::
Execute commands without editing them.

+-v+::
+--verbose+::
Print execution time before each history entry when printing.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{start}} and {{end}}::
The {{start}} and {{end}} operands specify a range of command history entries
that are executed or printed.
If one of the operands is an integer, it is treated as a history entry number.
A negative integer means the {{n}}th most recent entry where {{n}} is the
absolute value of the integer.
If one of the operands is not an integer, it is treated as part of a command
string: the most recent entry that starts with the string is selected as the
start or end of the range.
+
If the first entry of the range that is specified by {{start}} is newer than
the last entry of the range that is specified by {{end}}, the range is
reversed as if the +-r+ (+--reverse+) option was specified.
(If the option is already specified, it is cancelled.)
+
The default values for {{start}} and {{end}} are:
+
[width="50%",options="header"]
|===
|          |with +-l+ |without +-l+
|{{start}} |-16       |-1
|{{end}}   |-16       |same as {{start}}
|===

{{old}}={{new}}::
An operand of this format replaces part of the command string.
If the command string contains {{old}}, it is replaced with {{new}} and the
new string is executed.
Only the first occurrence of {{old}} is replaced.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

If commands was executed, the exit status of the fc built-in is that of the
last executed command.
Otherwise, the exit status is zero unless there is any error.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The fc built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[semi-special built-in].

The POSIX standard does not define the +-q+ (+--quiet+) or +-v+ (+--verbose+)
options, so they cannot be used in the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode].

Command history cannot be modified during link:lineedit.html[line-editing].
