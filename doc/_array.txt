[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +array+

- +array -s {{name}} {{index}} {{value}}+

[[description]]
== Description

When executed without any option or operands, the built-in prints all array
definitions to the standard output in a form that can be parsed as commands.

When executed with {{name}} and {{value}}s (but without an option), the
built-in sets the {{value}}s as the values of the array named {{name}}.

With the +-d+ (+--delete+) option, the built-in removes the {{index}}th values
of the array named {{name}}.
The number of values in the array will be decreased by the number of the
{{index}}es specified.
If the {{index}}th value does not exist, it is silently ignored.

With the +-i+ (+--insert+) option, the built-in inserts {{value}}s to the
array named {{name}}.
The number of values in the array will be increased by the number of the
{{value}}s specified.
The values are inserted between the {{index}}th and next values.
If {{index}} is zero, the values are inserted before the first value.
If {{index}} is larger than the number of values in the array, the values are
appended after the last element.

With the +-s+ (+--set+) option, the built-in sets {{value}} as the {{index}}th
value of the array named {{name}}.
The array must have at least {{index}} values.

[[options]]
== Options

+-d+::
+--delete+::
Delete array values.

+-i+::
+--insert+::
Insert array values.

+-s+::
+--set+::
Set an array value.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{name}}::
The name of an array to operate on.

{{index}}::
The index to an array element. The first element has the index of 1.

{{value}}::
A string to which the array element is set.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status of the array built-in is zero unless there is any error.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The array built-in is not defined in the POSIX standard.

The command +array {{name}} {{value}}...+ is equivalent to the assignment
+{{name}}=({{value}}...)+.
