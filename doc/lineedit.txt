//:title: Yash manual - Line-editing
:description: This page describes yash's line-editing feature.

With the dfn:[line-editing] feature, you can edit the command text
when you input a command to an link:interact.html[interactive shell].
It not only works as a simple visual-interface editor, but also is integrated
with the link:interact.html#history[command history].
You can recall, edit, and execute commands in the history with line-editing
instead of using the link:_fc.html[fc built-in].

Line-editing has two editing modes, the vi and emacs modes, which each have
their own key binding settings.
By switching editing modes, you can change key bindings used in line-editing.
Each mode has a corresponding link:_set.html#options[shell option],
which determines whether the mode is currently active or not.
No more than one mode can be active at a time, so the options for the other
modes are automatically turned off when you turn on the option for one mode.
The whole line-editing feature is deactivated when those options are off.

When an interactive shell is started, the vi mode is automatically activated
if the standard input and error are both connected to a terminal.

Line-editing can be used only when the standard input and error are both
connected to a terminal.
If not, the shell silently falls back to the normal input mechanism.
While line-editing is being used, the shell uses the termios interface to
change I/O settings of the terminal and the terminfo interface to parse input
key sequences.

[[options]]
== Shell options on line-editing

The following options can be set by the link:_set.html[set built-in]
to enable line-editing and choose an editing mode to activate:

link:_set.html#so-vi[vi]::
activates the vi mode.
link:_set.html#so-emacs[emacs]::
activates the emacs mode.

The other line-editing-related options are:

link:_set.html#so-lealwaysrp[le-always-rp]::
When this options is enabled, the right prompt is always visible:
when the cursor reaches the right prompt, it moves to the next line from the
original position, which would otherwise be overwritten by input text.

link:_set.html#so-lecompdebug[le-comp-debug]::
When enabled, internal information is printed during
<<completion,completion>>, which will help debugging completion scripts.

link:_set.html#so-leconvmeta[le-conv-meta]::
When enabled, the 8th bit of each input byte is always treated as a meta-key
flag, regardless of terminfo data.

link:_set.html#so-lenoconvmeta[le-no-conv-meta]::
When enabled, the 8th bit of each input byte is never treated as a meta-key
flag, regardless of terminfo data.
+
The le-conv-meta and le-no-conv-meta options cannot be both enabled at a time.
When either is enabled, the other is automatically disabled.
When neither is enabled, the 8th bit may be treated as a meta-key flag
depending on terminfo data.

link:_set.html#so-lepredict[le-predict]::
activates <<prediction,command line prediction>>.

link:_set.html#so-lepromptsp[le-prompt-sp]::
When enabled, the shell prints a special character sequence before printing
each prompt so that every prompt is printed at the beginning of a line.
+
This option is enabled by default.

link:_set.html#so-levisiblebell[le-visible-bell]::
When enabled, the shell flashes the terminal instead of sounding an alarm when
an alert is required.

[[modes]]
== Editing modes

The dfn:[vi mode] is an editing mode that offers key bindings similar to that
of the vi editor.
The vi mode has two sub-modes that are switched during editing:
the insert and command modes.
The sub-mode is always reset to the insert mode when line-editing is started
for a new command line.
In the insert mode, most characters are inserted to the buffer as typed.
In the command mode, input characters are treated as commands that move the
cursor, insert/delete text, etc.

The dfn:[emacs mode] offers key bindings similar to the emacs editor.
Most characters are inserted to the buffer as typed, but more characters are
treated as commands than the vi insert mode.

Another sub-mode is used while you enter search keywords.
The sub-mode is called the dfn:[search mode], which offers slightly different
key bindings depending on the active editing mode.

[[commands]]
== Line-editing commands

All characters the user enters while line-editing is active are treated as
line-editing commands listed below.
The link:_bindkey.html[bindkey built-in] allows customizing the key bindings
of each mode (except for the search mode).

The list below shows not only the functions of commands but also the default
key bindings.
The keywords ``vi-insert'', ``vi-command'', ``vi-search'', ``emacs'',
``emacs-search'' means the vi insert mode, the vi command mode, the search
mode for the vi mode (the vi search mode), the emacs mode, and the search mode
for the emacs mode (the emacs search mode), respectively.

Some commands take an argument that affects the function of the commands.
For example, the forward-char command moves the cursor by as many characters
as specified by the argument.
To specify an argument, use the digit-argument command just before another
command that takes an argument.

[[motion-commands]]
=== Motion commands

dfn:[Motion commands] move the cursor on the line.
Most motion commands accept an argument.
When passed an argument, they repeat the cursor motion as many times as
specified by the argument.
Passing ``4'' as an argument to the forward-char command, for example,
advances the cursor by four characters.

--
The shell has several definitions of words as units of distance:
A dfn:[bigword] is one or more adjacent non-whitespace characters.
A dfn:[semiword] is one or more adjacent characters that contain no
whitespaces or punctuations.
An dfn:[emacsword] is one or more adjacent alphanumeric characters.
A dfn:[viword] is either:

- one or more adjacent alphanumeric characters and/or underscores (+_+), or
- one or more adjacent characters that contain none of alphanumeric
  characters, underscores, and whitespaces.

INTR, EOF, KILL, and ERASE are special characters configured by the stty
command.
In a typical configuration, they are sent by typing Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+U,
and Ctrl+H, respectively, but some configuration uses Ctrl+? instead of Ctrl+H
for ERASE.

[[completion]]
== Command line completion

By using the complete and complete-next-candidate commands, etc., you can
complete command names, options, and operands.
By default, the complete-next-candidate command is bound with the Tab key in
the vi insert and emacs modes.

Type a few first letters of a command name or pathname and hit the Tab key,
and a list of matching names will be shown.
You can choose a candidate from the list to complete the name by hitting the
Tab key again.
If there is only one matching name, no list will be shown and the name will
directly be completed.

If the name to be completed contains characters like `*` and `?`, it is
treated as a link:pattern.html[pattern].
The name on the command line will be directly substituted with all possible
names matching the pattern (you cannot choose from a list).

Normally, command names are completed with command names and command arguments
with pathnames.
However, dfn:[completion functions] can be defined to refine completion
results.

[[completion-detail]]
=== Completion details

When doing completion for the first time after the shell has been started, the
INIT file is loaded as if the command string
+link:_dot.html[.] -AL completion/INIT+ is executed.
If the file is not found, it is silently ignored.
This automatic loading is mainly intended for loading completion functions
bundled with the shell, but you can let the shell load your own functions by
putting a file in the link:params.html#sv-yash_loadpath[load path].

When completing a command name, the shell executes the +completion//command+
function and when completing a command argument, the +completion//argument+
function.
If those completion functions are not defined, the shell just completes with
command names or pathnames.
When completing other names, such as the user name in
link:expand.html#tilde[tilde expansion] and the parameter name in
link:expand.html#params[parameter expansion], completion functions are never
used: the shell just completes with user names, parameter names, or whatever
applicable.

Completion functions are link:exec.html#function[executed] without any
arguments.
The following link:exec.html#localvar[local variables] are automatically
defined while executing completion functions:

link:params.html#sv-ifs[+IFS+]::
The value is the three characters of a space, a tab, and a newline, which are
the default value of the variable.
+WORDS+::
This variable is an link:params.html#arrays[array] whose elements are a
command name and arguments that have already been entered before the argument
being completed.
When completing a command name, the array has no elements.
+TARGETWORD+::
The value is the partially entered command name or argument that is being
completed.

Completion candidates are generated by executing the
link:_complete.html[complete built-in] during a completion function.

Completion functions must not perform I/O to the terminal, or displayed text
will be corrupted.
Completion functions should run as quickly as possible for better user
experience.

While a completion function is being executed:

- the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode] is temporarily disabled,
- the link:_set.html#so-errexit[err-exit option] is temporarily disabled, and
- link:_trap.html[traps] are not executed.

[[prediction]]
== Command line prediction

This is an experimental feature. When the
link:_set.html#so-lepredict[le-predict] option is enabled, the shell
automatically tries to predict a command string fragment that follows the part
of the command you have already typed in line-editing.

For example, assume you have once typed the command +ls Documents+. Next
time you start typing +ls Doc+, the shell will show +uments+ just after
the cursor. If you are satisfied with this suggestion, you can move the cursor
to the right by the forward-char or any other <<motion-commands,motion
commands>> instead of typing the rest of the command. After moving the cursor
after the last +s+, you can use the accept-line command to execute the
command. You can also use the accept-prediction command to immediately execute
the suggested command without moving the cursor.

To distinguish the typed part and the predicted part of a command string, you
can link:interact.html#prompt[change the font style] of the typed part by
setting the link:params.html#sv-ps1s[+PS1S+] variable. Customizing the font
style of the predicted part is not (yet) supported; it is always shown in the
default style.

When you move the cursor to the right, the predicted part up to the cursor
becomes the typed part as if you actually typed it. Moving the cursor to the
left does _not_ turn the typed part back to the prediction. Use deletion
commands such as backward-delete-char to delete typed command fragment.

The predicted part of the command is shown only when the cursor is at the end
of the typed part.

The prediction algorithm suggests command fragments on the basis of the
link:interact.html#history[command history]. The algorithm considers recent
history entries more probable. It also takes command succession patterns into
account. A predicted command fragment is not always a complete valid command
because less probable part of the fragment is excluded from prediction.
