The dfn:[fg built-in] resumes a job in the foreground.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +fg [{{job}}...]+

[[description]]
== Description

The fg built-in brings the specified job to the foreground and sends the
SIGCONT signal to the job.
As a result, the job is resumed in the foreground (if it has been suspended).
The built-in then waits for the job to finish and returns the exit status of
it.

The name of the job is printed when the job is resumed.

The built-in can be used only when link:job.html[job control] is enabled.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{job}}::
The link:job.html#jobid[job ID] of the job to be resumed.
+
If more than one job is specified, they are resumed in order, one at a time.
The current job is resumed if none is specified.
+
The percent sign (+%+) at the beginning of a job ID can be omitted if the
shell is not in the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct mode].

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status of the fg built-in is that of the (last) job resumed.
The exit status is non-zero when there was some error.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The fg built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[semi-special built-in].

You cannot specify more than one job in the link:posix.html[POSIXly-correct
mode].
