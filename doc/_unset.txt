//:title: Yash manual - Unset built-in

The dfn:[unset built-in] undefines variables or functions.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +unset [-fv] [{{name}}...]+

[[description]]
== Description

The unset built-in removes the definition of the
link:params.html#variables[variables] or link:exec.html#function[functions]
specified by operands.

It is not an error if any of the specified variables or functions do not
exist; they are silently ignored.

[[options]]
== Options

+-f+::
+--functions+::
Undefine functions.

+-v+::
+--variables+::
Undefine variables.

These options are mutually exclusive:
only the last specified one is effective.
If neither is specified, +-v+ is assumed.

[[operands]]
== Operands

{{name}}::
The name of a variable or function to be undefined.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status of the unset built-in is zero unless there is any error.

[[notes]]
== Notes

The unset built-in is a link:builtin.html#types[special built-in].

Although yash does not do so, the POSIX standard allows removing a function if
neither of the +-f+ and +-v+ options is specified and the specified variable
does not exist.
