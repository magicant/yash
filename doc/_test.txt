//:title: Yash manual - Test built-in

The dfn:[test built-in] evaluates an expression.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

- +test {{expression}}+
- +[ {{expression}} ]+

The test built-in does not distinguish options and operands;
all command line arguments are interpreted as {{expression}}.
If the built-in is executed in the name of +[+, {{expression}} must be
followed by +]+.

[[description]]
== Description

The test built-in evaluates {{expression}} as a conditional expression that is
made up of operators and operands described below.
The exit status is 0 if the condition is true and 1 otherwise.

The unary operators below test a file.
If the operand file is a symbolic link, the file referred to by the link is
tested (except for the +-h+ and +-L+ operators).

+-b {{file}}+:: {{file}} is a block special file
+-c {{file}}+:: {{file}} is a character special file
+-d {{file}}+:: {{file}} is a directory
+-e {{file}}+:: {{file}} exists
+-f {{file}}+:: {{file}} is a regular file
+-G {{file}}+:: {{file}}'s group ID is same as the shell's effective group ID
+-g {{file}}+:: {{file}}'s set-group-ID flag is set
+-h {{file}}+:: same as -L
+-k {{file}}+:: {{file}}'s sticky bit is set
+-L {{file}}+:: {{file}} is a symbolic link
+-N {{file}}+:: {{file}} has not been accessed since last modified
+-O {{file}}+:: {{file}}'s user ID is same as the shell's effective user ID
+-p {{file}}+:: {{file}} is a FIFO (named pipe)
+-r {{file}}+:: {{file}} is readable
+-S {{file}}+:: {{file}} is a socket
+-s {{file}}+:: {{file}} is not empty
+-u {{file}}+:: {{file}}'s set-user-ID flag is set
+-w {{file}}+:: {{file}} is writable
+-x {{file}}+:: {{file}} is executable

The unary operator below tests a file descriptor:

+-t {{fd}}+:: {{fd}} is associated with a terminal

The unary operators below test a string:

+-n {{string}}+:: {{string}} is not empty
+-z {{string}}+:: {{string}} is empty

The binary operators below compare files.
Non-existing files are considered older than any existing files.

+{{file1}} -nt {{file2}}+:: {{file1}} is newer than {{file2}}
+{{file1}} -ot {{file2}}+:: {{file1}} is older than {{file2}}
+{{file1}} -ef {{file2}}+:: {{file1}} is a hard link to {{file2}}

The binary operators below compare strings:

+{{string1}} = {{string2}}+::
{{string1}} is the same string as {{string2}}
+{{string1}} != {{string2}}+::
{{string1}} is not the same string as {{string2}}

The binary operators below compare strings according to the alphabetic order
in the current locale:

+{{string1}} === {{string2}}+::
{{string1}} is equal to {{string2}}
+{{string1}} !== {{string2}}+::
{{string1}} is not equal to {{string2}}
+{{string1}} < {{string2}}+::
{{string1}} is less than {{string2}}
+{{string1}} &lt;= {{string2}}+::
{{string1}} is less than or equal to {{string2}}
+{{string1}} > {{string2}}+::
{{string1}} is greater than {{string2}}
+{{string1}} >= {{string2}}+::
{{string1}} is greater than or equal to {{string2}}

The binary operators below compare integers:

+{{v1}} -eq {{v2}}+:: {{v1}} is equal to {{v2}}
+{{v1}} -ne {{v2}}+:: {{v1}} is not equal to {{v2}}
+{{v1}} -gt {{v2}}+:: {{v1}} is greater than {{v2}}
+{{v1}} -ge {{v2}}+:: {{v1}} is greater than or equal to {{v2}}
+{{v1}} -lt {{v2}}+:: {{v1}} is less than {{v2}}
+{{v1}} -le {{v2}}+:: {{v1}} is less than or equal to {{v2}}

The binary operators below compare version numbers:

+{{v1}} -veq {{v2}}+:: {{v1}} is equal to {{v2}}
+{{v1}} -vne {{v2}}+:: {{v1}} is not equal to {{v2}}
+{{v1}} -vgt {{v2}}+:: {{v1}} is greater than {{v2}}
+{{v1}} -vge {{v2}}+:: {{v1}} is greater than or equal to {{v2}}
+{{v1}} -vlt {{v2}}+:: {{v1}} is less than {{v2}}
+{{v1}} -vle {{v2}}+:: {{v1}} is less than or equal to {{v2}}

The operators below can be used to make complex expressions:

+! {{expression}}+:: negate (reverse) the result
+( {{expression}} )+:: change operator precedence
+{{expression1}} -a {{expression2}}+:: logical conjunction (and)
+{{expression1}} -o {{expression2}}+:: logical disjunction (or)

If the expression is a single word without operators, the +-n+ operator is
assumed. An empty expression evaluates to false.

[[version-compare]]
=== Comparison of version numbers

Comparison of version numbers is similar to comparison of strings in
alphabetic order.
The differences are:

- Adjacent digits are treated as an integer.
  Integers are compared in mathematical order rather than alphabetic order.
- Digits are considered larger than any non-digit characters.

For example, version numbers +0.1.2-3+ and +00.001.02-3+ are equal and +0.2.1+
is smaller than +0.10.0+.

[[exitstatus]]
== Exit status

The exit status of the test built-in is 0 if {{expression}} is true and 1
otherwise.
The exit status is 2 if {{expression}} cannot be evaluated because of a syntax
error or any other reasons.

[[notes]]
== Notes

Complex expressions may cause confusion and should be avoided.
Use the shell's link:syntax.html#compound[compound commands].
For example, +[ 1 -eq 1 ] && [ -t = 1 ] && ! [ foo ]+ is preferred over
+[ 1 -eq 1 -a -t = 1 -a ! foo ]+.

The POSIX standard provides that the exit status should be larger than 1 on
error.
The POSIX standard does not define the following operators:
+-nt+, +-ot+, +-ef+, +==+, +===+, +!==+, +<+, +&lt;=+, +>+, +>=+, +-veq+,
+-vne+, +-vgt+, +-vge+, +-vlt+, and +-vle+.
